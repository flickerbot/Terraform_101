This repository contains resources and examples for learning Terraform, an open-source infrastructure as code (IaC) tool that allows you to define, manage, and automate your cloud infrastructure.
Course Followed

This bootcamp is based on the Terraform Zero to Hero repository by Veeramalla Anil Kumar [GITHUB](https://github.com/iam-veeramalla/terraform-zero-to-hero) . The course is supplemented with video tutorials available on YouTube 
[YT](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLdpzxOOAlwvI0O4PeKVV1-yJoX2AqIWuf), which provide in-depth explanations and demonstrations of the concepts covered.


1. Basic Terraform Commands

    Terraform Init: Initializes a Terraform working directory by downloading and installing necessary provider plugins.
    Terraform Plan: Creates an execution plan, showing the proposed changes to the infrastructure.
    Terraform Apply: Applies the changes defined in the Terraform configuration to create, modify, or delete infrastructure resources.

2. Multi-Provider & Multi-Region Setup

    Multi-Providers: Learn how to configure and use multiple providers (e.g., AWS, Azure, Google) in a single Terraform file.
    Multi-Region Deployment: Deploy resources across multiple regions using the alias keyword.

3. Modules

    Creating Modules: Organize and encapsulate your infrastructure code into reusable components.
    Using Modules: Implement modules to create flexible and maintainable Terraform configurations.

4. Importing Resources

    Import existing cloud resources into your Terraform state, allowing you to manage them using Terraform.

5. Terraform Variables & Outputs

    Variables: Parameterize your configurations using .tfvars files.
    Outputs: Expose specific resource values for use in other configurations or for displaying important information.

6. Terraform State Files

    Understand the importance of Terraform state files in tracking resource changes and managing infrastructure over time.

7. Remote Backend

    Configure a remote backend (e.g., AWS S3) for storing Terraform state files, enabling team collaboration and maintaining consistency.

8.  Hashicorp Valut
   
    Integration with Hashicorp vault for secret storing and fetching 

9. Interview Questions

    Importing Configurations from CloudFormation to Terraform
    Migrating Existing Infrastructure to Terraform
    Drift Detection
    Terraform Refresh
    Configuring Strict IAM Rules
    Audit Logs for Manual Changes
